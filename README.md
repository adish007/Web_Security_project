# Web Security Pitfalls Project

## Summary

This project involved a security assessment of a simulated web application, "Bungle!". I identified and exploited common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).  I then implemented preventative measures, including prepared statements (SQL), input sanitization (HTML encoding), and CSRF token validation.  The goal was to gain practical experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating web security risks.

## Key Skills

*   Web Security: SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF
*   Programming: Python, SQL
*   Defensive Techniques: Prepared Statements, Input Sanitization, CSRF Tokens

## Key Achievements

*   Successfully exploited SQL Injection vulnerabilities to extract database information and bypass authentication.
*   Developed XSS payloads to achieve persistence and steal user information, bypassing various filter implementations.
*   Crafted CSRF attacks to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of users, even with token-based protections.
*   Implemented security measures to protect "Bungle!" from these attacks.
